* Personalizing packs

Emacs live ships with several default useful packs, however, some of them miss
configuration language I need to code in. This configures what I need.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(live-add-packs '(packages-management swiss-keyboard
                                      emacs-appearance lang-code))
#+END_SRC

I quite dislike emacs-live default color-theme. The following remove all the undesired package from emacs-live.


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq unwanted-packs '("colour-pack")) ; packs to not load at start.

(require 'cl)                           ; for the search fn
(defun keep-packs? (packs unwanted-packs)
  "Remove elements in elements in unwanted packs if they are partially
found in packs. E.g. \"colour-packs\" might be matched to \"stable/colour-packs\" and hence will be erased. "
  (delq nil (mapcar (lambda (s)
                      (when (not (and (stringp s)
                                      (some (lambda (x) (search x s))
                                            unwanted-packs))) s)) packs)))

(setq live-packs (keep-packs? live-packs unwanted-packs))
#+END_SRC

* Default application

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq dired-guess-shell-alist-user
      '(("\\.pdf$" "evince &"))) ;;; Set the shell instruction for opening your files.
#+END_SRC
